# poppler
Go bindings for poppler's C libraries

Tested under Ubuntu 16.06, after installing both libpoppler-glib-dev and libcairo2-dev

I've listed this as MIT license, poppler is licensed under both GPLv2 & GPLv3 (Seams you can pick, see: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/README-XPDF) Since i'm not an expert when it comes to licenses, if you understand this better than me then please let me know.
